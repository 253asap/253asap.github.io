      <h2>Gymshark</h2>
      <p>
        Gymshark is a uk-based fitness clothing and accessories company, which
        manufactures and own a website. Gymshark was created by a teenager, Ben
        Francis, in 2012 with a group of friends. The company orginally did
        screen printing in a garage, until it became widely recognisable and
        well known. Gymshark has customers and social media followers in 131
        different countries. This growth is attributed to Gymshark's devotion to
        creating effective and innovative performance wear. Their official
        vision statement is, "<span style="font-family: 'Marck Script', cursive"
          >Before there is an action, there is an idea. We exist to create the
          tools that help people unlock their full, incredible potential and put
          their ideas into action. Be all that you imagined you could be. Be a
          visionary. We exist to unite the conditioning community.</span
        >"
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Clothing itself</h2>
      <p>
        Gymshark creates clothing for both Men and Women, along with accessories
        like resitance bands and bags. Largest sizes I've spotted are XXL for
        men and XL for women. Prices aren't exactly cheap, with men's shirts
        starting at 20 dollars, but you get high quality for a good price. With
        very stylish designs, you'll look good and last longer in the gym.
