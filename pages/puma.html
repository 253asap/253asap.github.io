      <h2>Puma</h2>
      <p>
        Puma SE, branded as Puma, is a German multinational corporation that
        designs and manufactures athletic and casual footwear, apparel and
        accessories, which is headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany.
        Puma is the third largest sportswear manufacturer in the world. The
        company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler. In 1924, Rudolf and his
        brother Adolf "Adi" Dassler had jointly formed the company Gebr√ºder
        Dassler Schuhfabrik (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory). The relationship
        between the two brothers deteriorated until the two agreed to split in
        1948, forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma. Both companies are
        currently based in Herzogenaurach, Germany.
