      <p class="champInfo">
        The Champion Sports brand has been popular with college students and
        college sports teams since 1919. It was created by the Feinbloom
        Brothers. One of the reasons this brand is so popular is the pricing is
        fairly low compared to other sports brands.
      </p>
      <p class="champInfo">
        With that said, the reason for it’s low pricing is it’s quality.
        Champion sports brand is not a high end sports brand. If you’re wanting
        to buy a more higher quality brand, it’s better to look at what other
        brands offer.
